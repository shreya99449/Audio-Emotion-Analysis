# Future improvements:
# 1. Implement actual emotion detection model using deep learning
# 2. Improve gender detection using more sophisticated vocal features
# 3. Add support for batch processing
# 4. Implement caching for processed files
# 5. Extract voice quality features like jitter and shimmer
# 6. Train models on labeled emotion datasets
